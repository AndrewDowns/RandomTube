# RandomTube

This program uses Python and the Django library to randomly select a youtube video for the user and display it

The first version of this project would completely select a videoID at random based on Youtube's ID method however this caused too big a scope for videos that did not exist or were private. This first version uses the rstr library created by Leapfrog Online OSS development
